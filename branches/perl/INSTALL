Installing Apache Lucy with Perl bindings
=========================================

To install Apache Lucy as a suite of Perl modules, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    perl Build
    perl Build test
    perl Build install

Module::Build is required.  Since Perl 5.10.0, Module::Build has been bundled
with the Perl core, but on older systems it may be necessary to install it
from CPAN first.
